<h1>Choosing the Perfect Cheese</h1>
<p class="top-tip">All cheeses taste good so if you try a cheese and its good just eat it.</p>
<p>Choosing the cheese you like best could be hard.
You try them all and you forget what they taste like or you just cant find the perfect cheese.
There are so many cheeses out there you might like all of them.</p>
<h2>Soft Cheese</h2>
<p>If you are looking for <strong>soft cheese</strong> or some kind of cheese to put on bread there is
<ul><li>Laughing Cow Cheese</li>
<li>Sandwich cheese</li>
<li>Cheese Whiz</li></p></ul>
<p>Laughing Cow cheese is a type of soft cheese to spread on bread.
It comes in a circle packaging and inside there is little triangle with cheese inside.
It also comes in different kinds like garlic and herb,creamy swiss,cheddar and lots of more!<p>
<p>Sandwich cheese is a type of square cheese but its not spreadable.
Its a square piece of cheese for sandwichs and it doesnt taste as good by itself.</P>
<p>I like Cheese Whiz because its easy to spread and tastes like real cheese.</P>
<h2>Snack Cheese</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a <strong>snack</strong> there is
<ul><li>Cheese Strings</li>
<li>A normal block of cheese and crackers</li>
<li>And More</li><p>
<p>Cheese Strings is a small cheese cylindar and you can split it as many times as you want and eat it.
Its very fun and after you are done you get to eat it</p>
<p>You can also take a thin block of cheese and put it on top of the crackers and microwave it to eat.</p>
